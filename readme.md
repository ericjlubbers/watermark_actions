#Denver Post Watermark Actions

##Changelog:  
+ **ADDED:** Daily Camera logo in addition to DP, AP and Getty
+ **ADDED:** Individual actions to place each logo in any corner of an image (Top Left, Top Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Right).
+ **REMOVED:** Keyboard shortcuts. They made sense when there were only three actions, but now there are 16 actions to choose from. If you find you use a few regularly, just double click the action name to assign your own shortcuts.  

##How to Install:  
1. Download action file from repo (Social Watermarks.atn)  
2. Double-click to automatically install in Photoshop  
3. Hit Alt+F9 to open Actions tab  
4. Select folder for old Social Watermarks and hit the trash can icon at the bottom of the tab to clean up your tabs.  

##REQUIREMENTS
+ Currently, you must be connected to the O: Drive
+ A future version will be available to save to your machine locally in your C drive to get around that requirement. _Stay tuned_
