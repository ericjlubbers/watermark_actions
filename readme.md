Resizes and adds watermarks to photos for sharing on social media

###Step-by-step

2. Inserts watermark transparent png as new layer
3. Aligns layer to chosen corner with small amount of padding
4. Flattens image
5. Overwrites image opened in Photoshop (<-Important note for photographers. **Do not run these actions on any original files.** These were designed for social media folks to take already posted photos and mark them for sharing)
