#Denver Post Watermark Actions

##Changelog:  
+ **ADDED:** Entire package is now contained in a single zip file for use inside and outside our network or on home Windows machines.
+ **NOTE:** Even if the existing actions worked for you, you might want to use the local versions to include performance. But as they say, if it ain't broke ...

##Up Next:
+ Offline Mac version.

##How to Install (zipped version):
1. Download watermark.zip and extract the entire folder into your C: drive (**NOTE:** This _must be unzipped directly in your C: drive_, not inside any folder. Go to Computer and open the base C: drive)
2. In that folder, double-click on the file "Social Watermarks (local).atn" to automatically install in Photoshop  
3. Hit Alt+F9 to open Actions tab  
4. Select folder for old Social Watermarks and hit the trash can icon at the bottom of the tab to clean up your tabs. 

##How to Install (networked version):  
1. Download action file from repo (Social Watermarks.atn)  
2. Double-click to automatically install in Photoshop  
3. Hit Alt+F9 to open Actions tab  
4. Select folder for old Social Watermarks and hit the trash can icon at the bottom of the tab to clean up your tabs.  

##REQUIREMENTS
+ Currently, you must be connected to the O: Drive
+ A future version will be available to save to your machine locally in your C drive to get around that requirement. _Stay tuned_
